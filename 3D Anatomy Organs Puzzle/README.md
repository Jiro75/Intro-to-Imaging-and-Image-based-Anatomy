# ðŸŽ®ðŸ§© 3D Anatomy Puzzle Game: A Hands-On Learning Experience
Together with my talented team, we created an interactive 3D puzzle game centered around human anatomy! Our goal was to make learning about the bodyâ€™s organs and anatomy an interactive experience.

Hereâ€™s how we approached it:

1. Organ Selection: We started by choosing a specific organ to focus on, aiming for one that would capture interest and provide clear educational value.
2. Detailed 3D Modeling: Using Blender 3D, we built a realistic 3D model of the organ, ensuring it had all the intricate details necessary for an accurate representation.
3. Game Development in Unity: Within just two weeks, we developed the 3D puzzle game in Unity. This involved segmenting the 3D model into 5 pieces, each randomized in both position and orientation, and setting it up so players could pick up and manipulate each piece to reassemble the organ.
4. Interactive Controls: We implemented user-friendly controls that allowed players to rotate, flip, and snap pieces together, making the game feel engaging and accessible to users of all ages.
5. Enhanced Visual Feedback: To support learning, we color-coded the puzzle pieces and added alignment indicators that show when pieces fit correctly, improving the experience and ensuring that users get immediate feedback.

The result? A unique, hands-on anatomy puzzle that challenges usersâ€™ spatial skills while enhancing their understanding of the organâ€™s structure. By bringing together modern game development techniques and educational content, this project transformed complex medical material into a learning tool that anyone can engage with.
