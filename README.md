# üî¨ Biomedical Engineering Journey: Sophomore Year Chronicles
> *"Engineering is not just about following equations, but about improving the human condition."* ‚Äî __Yuan-Cheng Fung__

<h4>Welcome to Our Portfolio!</h4>
<p>This repository documents our transformation from curious sophomores to emerging biomedical engineers at Cairo University's Faculty of Engineering. Each project here represents a stepping stone in our engineering journey - from our first attempts at understanding the early concepts of coding üíª to increasingly complex biomedical applications üß¨.</p> <p>You'll find not just code and documents .. <br><br> but the story of how each challenge pushed us to think differently about healthcare solutions. Inside these folders lies a semester's worth of late nights , breakthrough moments , and valuable lessons learned.<br><br> Every project showcases not only technical proficiency but also our growing understanding of how engineering principles can be applied to improve patient care and medical technology ‚ù§Ô∏è.</p>
